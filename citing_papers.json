        "abstract": "The rapid advancement of large language models has intensified public concerns about the potential misuse. Therefore, it is important to build trustworthy AI-generated text detection systems. Existing methods neglect stylistic modeling and mostly rely on static thresholds, which greatly limits the detection performance. In this paper, we propose the Mixture of Stylistic Experts (MoSEs) framework that enables stylistics-aware uncertainty quantification through conditional threshold estimation. MoSEs contain three core components, namely, the Stylistics Reference Repository (SRR), the Stylistics-Aware Router (SAR), and the Conditional Threshold Estimator (CTE). For input text, SRR can activate the appropriate reference data in SRR and provide them to CTE. Subsequently, CTE jointly models the linguistic statistical properties and semantic features to dynamically determine the optimal threshold. With a discrimination score, MoSEs yields prediction labels with the corresponding confidence level. Our framework achieves an average improvement 11.34% in detection performance compared to baselines. More inspiringly, MoSEs shows a more evident improvement 39.15% in the low-resource case. Our code is available at https://github.com/creator-xi/MoSEs.",

To this end, Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting (ASTP) is introduced, a methodology centered on a strategically orchestrated prompt that compels an LLM to make its state-tracking process explicit and verifiable.

Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs), which encode rich semantics as directed graphs, offer a rigorous testbed for evaluating LLMs on text generation from such structures. Yet, current methods often arbitrarily linearize AMRs, discarding key structural cues, or rely on architectures incompatible with standard LLMs. We introduce SAFT, a structure-aware fine-tuning approach that injects graph topology into pretrained LLMs without architectural changes. We compute direction-sensitive positional encodings from the magnetic Laplacian of transformed AMRs and project them into the embedding space of the LLM. While possibly applicable to any graph-structured inputs, we focus on AMR-to-text generation as a representative and challenging benchmark. SAFT sets a new state-of-the-art on AMR 3.0 with a 3.5 BLEU improvement over baselines. Gains scale with graph complexity, highlighting the value of structure-aware representations in enhancing LLM performance. SAFT offers a general and effective pathway for bridging structured data and language models.",

Our proposed heterogeneous reconfigurable interconnect comprises on-package wired as well as wireless links to reduce communication latency. The interconnect is reconfigurable since at runtime it is decided which wireless links are to be utilized. Extensive experimental evaluations with different dense transformers show an improvement of up to 39.32% in communication latency with respect to state-of-the-art 2.5D systems.",

        "abstract": "Petroleum production prediction is a crucial task in reservoir monitoring and management, providing an indispensable basis for development scheme optimization. Most existing production prediction methods learn a joint representation for production dynamics using deep neural networks. However, these methods ignore the special temporal patterns of production dynamics and do not quantitatively analyze the impact of exogenous engineering measures on production. This may lead to insufficient generalization and guidance of the model in practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose a novel production analysis transformer for petroleum production prediction. Specifically, we leverage position enhancement and long-term interaction to explicitly capture the distinctive temporal patterns of production dynamics including local fluctuation and trend features. Furthermore, we establish covariate-level attention to evaluate the dynamic contribution of exogenous engineering measures to production. In this process, we design an adaptive aggregate mechanism that enables multihead attention to generate a single attention response, thereby improving the legibility of attention maps in engineering applications while maintaining the diversity of feature learning. With this task-specific design, our model learns disentangled production patterns and quantified exogenous influences, thereby enabling accurate and insightful production prediction. Comprehensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of our method in production prediction and its significance in engineering guidance.",

This paper introduces a nonconvex low-tubal-rank tensor completion model with temporal regularization (NLTC-TR) to fill in missing data based on the underlying physical properties of spatiotemporal traffic data, including similarity and periodicity. Our model can capture both the global correlations across different modes of traffic data and the local temporal variations. Specifically, we first present a unified nonconvex model to capture tubal rank along different dimensions while considering the specificity in each mode. The nonconvexity achieved by synergizing logarithm and Schatten-p norm serves as a tight rank approximation. In doing so, the low-rank property of traffic data can be better modeled in the transformed domains. Furthermore, by introducing a temporal regularization, we can make better use of the local variation between adjacent moments. To solve this problem, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), where each step can be solved in closed form. Numerical experiments on two real-world traffic datasets with varying missing patterns show that our method outperforms existing algorithms, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately recovering missing traffic data.",

        "abstract": "In the world of deep learning, transformer models have become very significant, leading to improvements in many areas, from understanding language to recognizing images, covering a wide range of applications. Despite their success, the deployment of these models in real-time applications, particularly on edge devices, poses significant challenges due to their computational intensity and memory demands. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel hybrid dynamic pruning (HDP) technique, an efficient algorithm-architecture codesign approach that accelerates transformers using head sparsity, block sparsity, and approximation to reduce computations in attention and reduce memory access. With the observation of the huge redundancy in attention scores and attention heads, we propose a novel integer-based block pruning to prune unimportant blocks in the attention matrix at run time. We also propose integer-based head pruning to detect and prune unimportant heads at an early stage at run time. Also, we propose an approximation method that reduces attention computations. To efficiently support these methods with lower latency, we propose the HDP accelerator (HDPA) as a coprocessor architecture, synthesized in two configurations—HDPA-edge and HDPA-server—to meet the needs of mobile and server platforms.

        "abstract": "Cross-database facial expression recognition (CDFER) has attracted increasing attention when evaluating the systems' generalization performance. Although the attention mechanism can capture the feature-wise importance or feature-correlation of expression sensitive regions, the attention-based network suffers from the overfitting to the source database, due to possible over-dependence on most salient features, without exploring feature characteristics during removal of feature redundancy. To address this issue, this paper introduces a multi-kernel competitive convolution in feature-wise attention to obtain more salient regions and let each kernel compete with others to enhance the expressive ability of features, by reducing attention overfitting to the source domain. For feature-correlation attention, we resort to a Monte Carlo-based dropout to not only reduce the over-learning of the feature relationship, but also model the dropout probability distribution more specifically by taking the characteristics of feature maps into account. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves much better generalization performances than the state of the arts (SOTAs) on six publicly available datasets, in the scenarios of single source domain, multiple source domains and domain adaption.",

Recent advancements have aimed to accelerate SpMM by harnessing the powerful Tensor Cores found in modern GPUs. However, despite these efforts, existing methods frequently encounter performance degradation when ported across different Tensor Core architectures. Recognizing that scalable SpMM across multiple generations of Tensor Cores relies on the effective use of general-purpose instructions, we have meticulously developed a SpMM library named SSpMM. However, a significant conflict exists between granularity and performance in current Tensor Core instructions. To resolve this, we introduce the innovative Transpose Mapping Scheme, which elegantly implements fine-grained kernels using coarse-grained instructions. Additionally, we propose the Register Shuffle Method to further enhance performance. Finally, we introduce Sparse Vector Compression, a technique that ensures our kernels are scalable with both structured and unstructured sparsity. Our experimental results, conducted on four generations of Tensor Core GPUs using over 3,000 sparse matrices from well-established matrix collections, demonstrate that SSpMM achieves an average speedup of 2.04 ×, 2.81 ×, 2.07 ×, and 1.87 ×, respectively, over the state-of-the-art SpMM solution. Furthermore, we have integrated SSpMM into PyTorch, achieving a 1.81 × speedup in end-to-end Transformer inference compared to cuDNN.",

In this letter, we propose a scalable exploration framework that integrates heterogeneous topological representations, lightweight global-local graph reasoning, and reinforcement learning. Our framework is computationally efficient, comprehensively considers global spatial context, and generalizes effectively across diverse environmental scenarios. We introduce a compact topological abstraction to encode crucial spatial and semantic information, substantially reducing map complexity. A novel hybrid inference module, combining linear global attention with local graph convolutions, effectively integrates long-range exploration with comprehensive local coverage. We further design a minimalist reward function paired with a curriculum learning to ensure stable training and enhanced generalization. A viewpoint-based action masking mechanism further refines the action space, accelerating learning convergence. Extensive simulations demonstrate our method consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 14.5% shorter exploration time and 18.8% reduced path length while maintaining low computational overhead. Real-world experiments further validate the practical effectiveness of our approach for robotic exploration tasks.",

To address these challenges, we propose an innovative spatio-temporal attention fusion navigation framework called STAF-Navi. The framework integrates spatio-temporal attention mechanisms to model sequential dependencies. It captures spatial and temporal correlations from historical observations and actions to improve navigation and obstacle avoidance. STAF-Navi employs deep collision encoding to compress high-dimensional depth images into informative low-dimensional latent states, and a single-site Transformer to model historical sensor inputs and states, enhancing the utility of current observations. By exploiting temporal dependencies, this integration enables early braking and stable hovering. Extensive simulation experiments show that the framework increases the navigation success rate by 10% and improves path efficiency by 7%. Finally, the successful deployment of the proposed strategy in real-world scenarios validates its effectiveness.",

Our approach utilizes channel state information (CSI) across eight channels as a localization fingerprint. To minimize labor-intensive site surveys for fingerprint database construction and maintenance, we develop a CSI generative model (CGM) that learns the relationship between CSI vectors and their corresponding locations. The CGM is fine-tuned using CSI data from static agricultural LoRa sensor nodes, enabling continuous fingerprint database updates.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, the accuracy of the inference depends deeply on the contexts of queries, especially for personal services. Abundant mobile sensing data collected by sensors embedded in smart devices can proactively capture real-time user contexts. However, raw sensing data are low-quality (e.g., existing missing data and data redundancy) and are incapable of providing accurate contexts. In this work, we present ConGen, a user context generation framework for LLMs, aiming at prompting users’ contexts through their implicit mobile sensing information. ConGen integrates two components: refined data completion and multi-granularity context compression. Specifically, the refined data completion couples data-centric feature selection by leveraging the eXplainable AI (XAI) method into the data imputation model to generate fewer but more informative features for efficient and effective context generation. Additionally, we implement multi-granularity context compression, reducing timestep- and context-level data redundancy while further elevating context quality. Experiment results show that ConGen can generate more accurate context, surpassing competitive baselines by 1.3%-8.3% in context inference on all four datasets. Moreover, context compression significantly reduces redundancy to <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1/70\\sim 1/40$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>70</mml:mn><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>40</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"zheng-ieq1-3591561.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> of the original data amount, and further improves the context accuracy. Finally, the enhanced performance of LLMs, as demonstrated by both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of prompting ConGen-generated user contexts, underscores the effectiveness of ConGen.",
        "abstract_summary_gcp": "This paper introduces **ConGen**, a novel user context generation framework designed to provide high-quality contextual information for Large Language Models (LLMs) from implicit mobile sensing data.\n\nThe problem ConGen addresses is that while LLMs benefit greatly from accurate contexts for personalized services, raw mobile sensing data is often low-quality (e.g., missing data, redundancy) and thus unreliable for direct use.\n\nConGen tackles this through two main components:\n1.  **Refined Data Completion:** This component integrates data-centric feature selection using eXplainable AI (XAI) with a data imputation model. Its goal is to generate a smaller, more informative set of features, leading to efficient and effective context generation.\n2.  **Multi-granularity Context Compression:** This component reduces both timestep- and context-level data redundancy, which not only shrinks the data footprint but also further elevates the quality of the generated contexts.\n\nExperimental results show ConGen significantly improves context inference accuracy by 1.3%-8.3% over baselines across four datasets. The context compression is highly effective, reducing data redundancy to 1/70 to 1/40 of the original amount, while surprisingly *also* enhancing context accuracy.

However, existing methods often lack a unified mechanism to simultaneously capture subtle local motion features and global semantic context, which are both essential for accurate recognition. To address this limitation, we propose a Dual-scale Spatial-Temporal Excitation (DSTE) module that explicitly integrates temporal and spatial features across both local and global scales, enhancing the network to effectively capture fine-grained motion and long-range dependencies. The plug-and-play DSTE module can be seamlessly incorporated into standard 2D architectures such as ResNet-50, forming a more expressive framework referred to as DSTE-Net, while adding only 1.99 GFLOPs. Extensive experiments on the EgoGesture, IPNHand, and LD-ConGR datasets using only RGB videos as input demonstrate that DSTE-Net achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Cross-hospital collaboration has the potential to mitigate disparities in medical resources across different regions. However, strict privacy regulations prohibit the direct sharing of sensitive patient information between hospitals. Vertical federated learning (VFL) provides a novel privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm designed to maximizes data utility across multiple hospitals. Nevertheless, traditional VFL methods primarily benefit patients with overlapping data, leaving non-overlapping patients without guaranteed improvements in distributed healthcare prediction services. While some existing knowledge transfer techniques attempt to improve prediction performance for non-overlapping patients, they fail to adequately address scenarios where overlapping and non-overlapping patients originate from different domains, resulting in challenges such as feature and label heterogeneity. To address these issues, we propose UniTrans, a unified vertical federated knowledge transfer framework for edge healthcare collaboration. Our framework consists of three key steps. First, we extract the federated representation of overlapping patients by employing an effective vertical federated representation learning method to model multi-party joint features online. Next, each hospital learns a local knowledge transfer module offline, enabling the domain-adaptive transfer of knowledge from the federated representation of overlapping patients to the enriched representation of local non-overlapping patients. Finally, hospitals utilize these enriched local representations to enhance performance across various downstream medical prediction tasks. Extensive experiments on real-world medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of UniTrans in both intra-domain and cross-domain knowledge transfer.",

        "abstract": "Multimodal Summarization aims to use multimodal data to generate accurate and concise summaries for long sentences. While previous work has achieved promising success, they have overlooked the mismatching among multimodal semantics and lacked subject information guidance for adaptive referential images. Motivated by this observation, we propose ASSM, an Adaptive Subject-focused modeling for multimodal summarization via Semantic Matching. The novelty of ASSM lies in two aspects. First, we propose a multimodal semantic matching module that projects multimodal inputs into a shared joint embedding semantic space to determine whether the semantics between multimodalities are mismatching. Second, we propose an adaptive subject-focused guide module, which adaptively references images to learn subject tokens based on the multimodal semantic matching results. With these subject tokens, we are able to focus on the subject information, providing precise guidance for summary generation. We conduct extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks and compare ASSM with 17 existing models. The experimental results regarding ROUGE, BERTScore, and MoverScore show that the proposed ASSM model outperforms all competitors, achieving state-of-the-art performance and suggesting the effectiveness of our proposal. In addition, we provide a case study to further demonstrate the usability of ASSM.",

Transformer-based models have demonstrated strong performance in sequential tasks; however, their reliance on dot-product attention renders them sensitive to noise and less effective for misaligned time series. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dynamic time warping (DTW)-based attention mechanism, leveraging a Sakoe-Chiba-constrained soft-DTW framework to replace the traditional dot-product similarity. This approach enables dynamic sequence alignment, enhancing robustness to temporal misalignments. Building on this innovation, we introduce DTWformer, a multi-scale Transformer model that integrates DTW-attention with adaptive patching to capture dependencies across varying temporal resolutions. DTWformer achieves superior forecasting performance and efficiency, addressing the limitations of existing approaches in handling misaligned and noisy time series.",

        "abstract": "Over the years, various sophisticated deep learning algorithms have surfaced for multivariate time series classification (MTSC), notably the dual-network-based model. This model comprises two parallel networks tailored to time series data: one for local feature extraction and the other for global relation extraction. However, effectively integrating these dual networks poses a significant challenge. To address this, we propose a knowledge aggregation transformer network (KATN) for MTSC. KATN, composed of four aggregation transformer blocks, extracts abundant regularizations and connections hidden within the data. Each block incorporates a modified residual network (MResNet) for local feature extraction and a multi-head attention network for global relation extraction. Initially, the block merges MResNet’s output feature with that of the multi-head attention network through an additive operation. Subsequently, it aligns features with a fully connected (i.e., dense) layer and activates neural units using the Gaussian error linear unit function. This strategic feature aggregation allows for capturing long-range dependencies among multiple variables in multivariate time series data. Experimental results demonstrate that KATN significantly outperforms 6 state-of-the-art transformer variants, achieving a ‘win’/‘tie’/‘lose’ record of 9/6/15 and securing the lowest AVG_rank score. Furthermore, when evaluated against 18 existing MTSC algorithms across 13 UEA datasets, KATN consistently delivers superior performance, attaining the lowest AVG_rank score among all compared methods.",

To address this challenge, a transformer-based DG architecture is developed. First, the architecture leverages the global attention mechanism of the transformer, incorporating new patch encoding and token designs. Second, a multisource domains adversarial learning method is employed to extract domain invariant features that are robust to condition shifts. Finally, a causal trend alignment loss is introduced. It reduces personalized bias across different working conditions by aligning the causal trends of the same fault class.

Optimizing their resource allocation not only reduces operational costs but also minimizes energy consumption and associated carbon emissions, contributing to sustainable computing. This article introduces TempoSight, a novel hybrid deep learning (DL) architecture designed for multivariate (MV) time-series forecasting, specifically targeting carbon-intelligent resource provisioning in cloud DCs. TempoSight synergistically combines the strengths of patch time-series transformers (PatchTST), excelling at capturing global context and long-range dependencies, and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, mastering sequential dynamics. To address the critical need for efficient hyperparameter tuning in complex DL models, we propose a cuckoo search algorithm (CSA)-based optimization approach. This enables efficient training and optimization of TempoSight for MV time-series forecasting, leading to improved resource utilization predictions. Rigorous evaluation on the Alibaba and Bitbrains datasets, representing diverse real-world IIoT workload patterns, demonstrates TempoSight’s superior accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art DL models. Notably, under high-load conditions, TempoSight achieves a remarkable 10%–15% reduction in root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). This research highlights the critical role of hybrid DL models and intelligent optimization in achieving accurate and efficient resource provisioning, paving the way for carbon-aware IIoT applications and contributing to the broader goals of sustainable and green computing.

Existing studies typically assume that communicating parties share a common database. However, this assumption poses significant privacy risks, particularly in intervehicle scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a federated-learning-based semantic-aware communication for vehicular networks. In this approach, each intelligent vehicle locally trains a semantic communication model and uploads its model parameters to the edge server for aggregation. To further enhance data transmission efficiency, we introduce a semantic-aware vector quantized variational autoencoder (SVQ-VAE) architecture as the local semantic communication model. This architecture optimizes transmission by selectively compressing and quantizing only the most relevant semantic information for the task. In addition, to address data heterogeneity among vehicles, we propose a hypernetwork-based personalized federated learning (HPFL) scheme. This approach enhances the model’s scalability and generalization by training a hypernetwork at the edge server to generate specific weight parameters for each vehicle’s semantic communication model. Simulation experiments on the CIFAR-10 and BDD100K datasets demonstrate that our proposed federated-learning-based semantic-aware communication achieves superior task completion rates, semantic transmission efficiency (STE), and transmission delay compared with existing federated semantic communication architectures.",

To mitigate these challenges, a federated learning approach is developed by integrating long short-term memory (LSTM), the transformer-large language model (LLM)-based foundation models, and advanced encryption standard (AES) cryptography. The proposed approach is named the responsible federated foundation model (ResFedFM). To ensure secure federated learning computation and data security at the edge (smart meter), fog (SCADA-based substation grid), and cloud (grid cloud server) layers of the SG-IIoT, a self-parent key-based cryptography method has been developed by combining AES with hash-based message authentication code (HMAC). A load forecasting algorithm called LSTM-LLM-GenResAI-Forecasting has been designed for computation at each end node of the federated learning process. The edge node forecast outputs are encrypted and aggregated at the fog node. At the fog node, the data are decrypted, and the aggregation algorithm of the federated learning process is used to generate the overall load forecasting of each sub-station grid. Again, the forecast data from these fog nodes are aggregated in an encrypted state at the cloud level, and overall load forecasts are generated for multiple fog nodes.

To mitigate yield losses caused by pests, timely and precise pest management practices are critical. Although previous efforts have advanced automated solutions for real-time environmental monitoring in agriculture, implementing precise pest management decision-making and suggestion generation remains a challenge due to complex reasoning processes in practice. In response, an enhanced pest management system, PEZEGO, is proposed to provide precise management suggestions through multimodal environmental data, a fine-tuned open vocabulary detector (OVD), and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, a mobile application and low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) devices are developed to capture images and environmental information. A hybrid convolutional low-rank adaptation method (HCLoRA) is proposed to fine-tune pretrained OVDs, enabling zero-shot pest detection for converting images to pest species and quantity information. In addition, a structured data-based retrieval augmented generation (SRAG) workflow for LLMs is proposed to provide precise pest management suggestions through automatically extracted agriculture management knowledge and Chain-of-Thought. The effectiveness of PEZEGO is validated in a case study of pest management in the U.K., including pest detection in field scenarios and management suggestion generation. Compared to advanced model fine-tuning methods, HCLoRA for YOLOWorld achieves the highest detection performance with $0.1759~AP^{h}$ on pest detection. Additionally, the proposed SRAG workflow demonstrates the ability to support pest management with a 68.7% average F1 score for knowledge extraction and 77.33% accuracy for suggestion generation. Eventually, a mobile application demonstrates the practical effectiveness of the proposed system.",

Additionally, a Structured Data-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (SRAG) workflow for Large Language Models (LLMs) provides precise management suggestions by utilizing automatically extracted agricultural knowledge and Chain-of-Thought reasoning.\n\nA U.K. case study validated PEZEGO's effectiveness: HCLoRA, particularly with YOLOWorld, achieved superior pest detection performance ($0.1759~AP^{h}$), while the SRAG workflow demonstrated a 68.7% F1 score for knowledge extraction and 77.33% accuracy for suggestion generation. A mobile application further showcases the system's practical utility.",

        "abstract": "The rapid evolution of brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) has significantly influenced the domain of human–computer interaction, with steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) emerging as a notably robust paradigm. This study explores advanced classification techniques leveraging interpretable fuzzy transfer learning (iFuzzyTL) to enhance the adaptability and performance of SSVEP-based systems. Recent efforts have been made to reduce calibration requirements through innovative transfer learning approaches, which refine cross-subject generalizability and minimize calibration through strategic application of domain adaptation and few-shot learning strategies. Pioneering developments in deep learning (DL) also offer promising enhancements, facilitating robust domain adaptation and significantly improving system responsiveness and accuracy in SSVEP classification. However, these methods often require complex tuning and extensive data, limiting immediate applicability. iFuzzyTL introduces an adaptive framework that combines fuzzy logic principles with neural network architectures, focusing on efficient knowledge transfer and domain adaptation. iFuzzyTL refines input signal processing and classification in a human-interpretable format by integrating fuzzy inference systems (FISs) and attention mechanisms. This approach bolsters the model’s precision and aligns with real-world operational demands by effectively managing the inherent variability and uncertainty of EEG data. The model’s efficacy is demonstrated across three datasets: 12JFPM (89.70% accuracy for 1 s with an information transfer rate (ITR) of 149.58), Benchmark (85.81% accuracy for 1 s with an ITR of 213.99), and eldBETA (76.50% accuracy for 1 s with an ITR of 94.63), achieving state-of-the-art results and setting new benchmarks for SSVEP BCI performance.",
